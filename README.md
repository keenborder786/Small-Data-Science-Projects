# Small-Data-Science-Projects
These consist of small projects related to analysing data and then making a predictor-many datasets are from kaggle.

Please note that datasets are from kaggle and therefore most of these small projects are actual competitions from kaggle but some of them are datasets which I have taken from elsewhere and then made a project aroud that dataset. Now let me explain each of the project(I will keep updating this):

1-costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction--This file consis of two main python files, in which I have tried to clean the data and then tried to use both supervise and unsupervise learning method to analyse weather a particular household in Costa Rican is impoverish or not. I tried to combine the results and tried to see through unsupervised methods, as how many classes of living style are present and which classes are actually impoverish. The basic idea was to classify the household living class depending on specific features.


2-Future Store Sales Predictor-An Interest Problem in which I combined different stores data(Same Company) and given the number and type of items that were sold in each of the store, I tried to predict what the future sales will be for each of the store.

3-pubg ranker-An competition from kaggle in which we had to predict what will be the ranking of the player, as this stage I was not aware of ensembling method or deep learning therefore  I tried to USE SVR to predict the ranking of player which did not turn out to be that accurate.

4-Audio_Analyser-This is project in which I tried to create a voice analyser, which tend to graph the frequency of your voice and tend to record your voice if permitted.

5-Bit Coin-Bit Coin Price Predictor with Visulisation.

6-CAPM MODEL-Actual implementation of Capital Asset Pricing Model in Python

7-Customer Purchase Predictor-Tries to analys the customer purchasing pattern and then predict what amount they are likely to spend.

8-FaceBook Metric-A company facebook page statistics and then using this FB page as a metric, I tried to see which type of posting(e.g status,video or images) was most successfull in attracting new users to the company.

9-Fifa 19 player analyser-Another Competition from Kaggle, I used unsupervised method to detect how many types of classification were present in player and then using these classification, I tried to show how different were the statistics for each of classification found through unsupervised method.

10-Heart disease predictor,Irsis Eye Project-Simple Datasets(related to classifications)

11-S and P 500 data-S an P 500 price predictor




12-STOCK REAL TIME DATA SEARCHING GRAPH_1-One of my most ambition project in which I try to collect real time data of stocks from the internet through an API and then try to visualise the collected data nad immediately run the collected Data through CAPM model to predict the future movement.

13-Admission Prediction-Kaggle Challenege in which we had to predict the chance of admit given their scores and other academic performance indicators.
